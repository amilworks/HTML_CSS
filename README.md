# Building a Landing Page from Scratch


This is my first attempt at HTML and CSS on my own. My inspiration came from seeing websites with cool landing pages. Perhaps it was jealousy, or perhaps it was curiosity, but nonetheless people get paid to do this and I wanted to see how hard it was. Surprisingly, it was pretty simple. 

## Time

This project took me about three hours. I know, I learn slow.
