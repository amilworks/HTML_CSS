# Building a Landing Page from Scratch


This is my first attempt at `HTML` and `CSS` on my own. My inspiration came from seeing websites with cool landing pages. Perhaps it was jealousy, or perhaps it was curiosity, but nonetheless people get paid to do this and I wanted to see how hard it was. Surprisingly, it was pretty simple.

## Time

This project took me about three hours. I know what you're thinking. It took me three hours to code this simple thing, and within those three hours, you already cracked like six cold ones with the boys. To that I say, trust the process.
